_Starter project for Front End Web Development JavaScript and the DOM module_

## Introduction

This starter project is used for illustrating the DOM and using JavaScript to interact with the DOM.

## View Demo

For a demonstration of the page visit [this link](https://thinkful-ed.github.io/starter-national-parks/).

## Getting started

Fork this repository then clone your fork to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/starter-national-parks.git
```

Navigate to the folder containing the repository and start a local server. For example you may use _lite-server_.

```bash
npx lite-server
```

> **lite-server** is a lightweight _development only_ node server that serves a web app, opens it in the browser, and refreshes when html or javascript changes occur.

Open the code in your favourite editor. For instance, to open VSCode:

```bash
code .
```
